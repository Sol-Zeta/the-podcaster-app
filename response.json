      "description": "Summary\n\nIn this conversation, The Millennial General and Quinashai Chelette discuss the concept of protection in Hollywood and who is really protected in the industry. They specifically focus on JLo and her perceived protection, as well as other artists who have been protected or not protected. They also touch on the importance of power and time in the industry, the impact of social media, and the challenges faced by artists in navigating the industry. In this conversation, the hosts discuss the casting choices in Hollywood and the impact of the Me Too movement. They explore the idea that sometimes actors are chosen for roles based on their popularity rather than their suitability, using examples like Kevin Hart and Jennifer Lopez. They also touch on the Me Too movement and its limitations, suggesting that it needs a restart to address the stories that haven't been told. The conversation concludes with a discussion about AI technology and its potential impact on society.\n\n\n\nSupport this podcast at — https://redcircle.com/more-than-just-an-interview/donations\n\nAdvertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands\n\nPrivacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy",
